I recently got a minor concussion while playing ultimate frisbee. It is the first brain injury I have ever had, as far as I know. There was one time when I was about 13 or 14 that I fell while snowboarding then got woken up by my sister. I am pretty sure that is also when I dislocated my shoulder, something that bothers me today. The lesson there being that you should always see a doctor, even if it interrupts your ski vacation.

In life, it is best to try and take the positive out of any situation. For this reason, I took this concussion as an opportunity to take a step back and re-evaluate where I am in my career and in life, as well to try and simplify my life a little bit. 

According to the doctor, I was to keep my screen time to < 2 hours a day and avoid any strenuos activity for the week after I got the concussion. Seeing as I spend 12+ hours a day on the computer doing my job, then doing my side projects after work, this was tough. 

At first I was overwhelmed. What am I going to do with my time? Do I just lay here all day? Do I walk around the city all day? All the while in this haze of brain injury. No fun.

I ended up downloading days worth of audiobooks, signing up for an Audacity account and started listening to podcasts. I even got so tired of not being able to work that I started listening to coding podcasts, something that for whatever reason I had not considered to be worth my time before.

This last month has been tough. But it has also been one of the best months of my life as far as personal growth. I feel like I know myself much better know, I feel like I know where I am going, and I feel like I am on my way to having what it takes to get there.

So, I guess that's my advice for this post - get a concussion, it will change your life.... Just kidding. But really though, we can all learn to unplug sometimes.

print_hi('Reader')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
